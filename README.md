# CS50_ProjectPortfolio

A collection of projects showcasing my journey of learning computer science and programming with CS50x, and possible reference material for future me! It covers a wide range of topics like algorithms, data structures, security and web development.

## Description

In this repository, you will find a mixture of different types of assignments that I did during the course. They are implemented in different programming languages like C, Python, JavaScript, and Scratch. They helped me develop my skills and understanding of the concepts taught in the course, and gave me hands-on experience working with different tools and technologies.

## Running the code

To run the code, you will need to have the appropriate software and libraries installed on your computer. Each project has its own set of dependencies, so, yeah.. Keep that in mind.

## Note

Please note that the projects in this repository are my own work and they may not be the exact solutions provided by the course and is in no way even close to being the best. Although, it gives a perfect score.
